        We are creating a short video like tiktok, or youtube short.
        {sub_prompt}
        Do not include any markdown, backticks, or code formatting â€” just output the content as plain text.

        Give me a response in json-like format: 

        chose either trivia or facts to present 

        - for trivia videos:
        type: "trivia",
        intro:"",
        cta: "",
        outro: "", 
        {{
        [Question: "...",
        Options: [],
        answer: "...",
        img_keywords: ["..",".."],
        wait_time: // time in seconds
        ], ... more}},
        topic_keyword="keywords related to the content" // one or two words


        - for facts:
        type: "facts",
        intro:"",
        cta:"",
        outro:"",
        facts:[{{fact: "", img_keywords:[""...]}}...more facts],
        topic_keyword="keywords related to the content" // one or two words

        for trivia questions, you need to add a 10s or 5s timer after each question depending on the difficulty.

        Make the script very engaging. For example ask users to interact with the platform like comment, like and share.
        Also ask them to answer something in comment. (example: Type something with eyes closed in the comments)
        Do not CTA in the beginning do it in the middle of the video or at the end.
        Make the script clean, no special characters, only very few emojis and text.

        Make sure you have at least 10 questions or facts if it is short.
        For longer ones you can have 5. Make sure the video script will be around 1-1.5 minutes long.
