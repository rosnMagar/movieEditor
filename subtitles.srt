00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,360
Ever

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,640
notice

3
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:00,800
how

4
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,880
the

5
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,000
most

6
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,320
profound

7
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,600
thoughts

8
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:01,800
strike

9
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,920
when

10
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,120
you're

11
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,240
just

12
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,360
trying

13
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,480
to

14
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,760
rinse

15
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:02,880
off

16
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,000
the

17
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,520
shampoo?

18
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,880
You're

19
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,160
standing

20
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,320
there,

21
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,560
water

22
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,120
cascading

23
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,320
down,

24
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,560
and

25
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,040
suddenly

26
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,280
your

27
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,480
mind

28
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,920
dives

29
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,080
into

30
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,200
the

31
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,440
depths

32
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,520
of

33
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:07,600
the

34
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,000
universe.

35
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Here

36
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,480
are

37
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,560
some

38
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,840
unique

39
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,120
shower

40
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,360
thoughts

41
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,600
to

42
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,880
if

43
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,000
we

44
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,160
can't

45
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,280
see

46
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,480
air,

47
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,680
can

48
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:10,880
fish

49
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,000
see

50
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,240
water?

51
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,440
If

52
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,560
your

53
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,760
shirt

54
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,000
isn't

55
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,240
tucked

56
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,360
into

57
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,480
your

58
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,760
pants,

59
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,000
are

60
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,160
your

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,400
pants

62
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,680
tucked

63
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:13,800
into

64
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:13,920
your

65
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,240
shirt?

66
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,520
If

67
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,680
you

68
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:14,800
were

69
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,000
born

70
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,240
deaf,

71
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,400
what

72
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,720
language

73
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:15,840
would

74
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:15,999
you

75
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:16,199
think

76
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:16,480
in?

77
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:16,800
Can

78
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:16,920
you

79
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,080
ever

80
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,360
truly

81
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,600
touch

82
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:17,920
anything

83
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,120
or

84
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,240
are

85
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,360
you

86
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,520
always

87
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:18,680
just

88
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,960
touching

89
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,120
the

90
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,240
space

91
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,480
between

92
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,040
atoms?

93
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,280
If

94
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,480
you're

95
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,800
invisible

96
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,040
and

97
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,240
you

98
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,400
close

99
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,520
your

100
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,800
eyes,

101
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,000
can

102
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,120
you

103
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,280
still

104
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,440
see

105
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,600
through

106
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:22,760
your

107
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,120
eyelids?

108
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,320
If

109
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,480
two

110
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:23,840
vegans

111
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:23,920
are

112
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,280
arguing,

113
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,480
is

114
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,600
it

115
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,760
still

116
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,080
considered

117
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,200
a

118
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,520
beef?

119
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:25,900
Let

120
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,060
these

121
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,260
thoughts

122
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,540
simmer

123
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:26,660
as

124
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:26,740
you

125
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:26,820
go

126
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:26,940
about

127
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,100
your

128
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,380
day.

129
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,740
Who

130
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:27,940
knows

131
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,060
what

132
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,500
revelations

133
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,820
await

134
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:28,900
in

135
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,020
your

136
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,180
next

137
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,620
shower?

138
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:29,900
If

139
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,060
any

140
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,180
of

141
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,300
these

142
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,540
blew

143
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:30,700
your

144
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:30,940
mind?

145
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,220
Like

146
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:31,500
share

147
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:31,780
and

148
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,020
drop

149
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,100
the

150
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,420
weirdest

151
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,540
thought

152
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:32,740
you've

153
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:32,860
had

154
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:32,980
in

155
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,060
the

156
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,300
comments.

157
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,780
Let's

158
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:33,860
see

159
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:33,980
who

160
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,300
surprises

161
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,460
us

162
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:34,580
the

163
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,820
most.
