1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,160
You

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,240
are

3
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,600
witnessing

4
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,840
history

5
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,080
being

6
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,280
made

7
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,480
right

8
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:01,760
now.

9
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,120
Get

10
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,320
ready

11
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,400
to

12
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,760
redefine.

13
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,280
Impossible.

14
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,880
Nicholas

15
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,360
Plytas

16
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,480
just

17
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,760
stomped

18
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:04,880
the

19
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,000
first

20
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,160
ever

21
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,400
double

22
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,800
backflip

23
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:05,920
on

24
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,000
a

25
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,640
surfboard.

26
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,000
Think

27
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,200
about

28
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,520
that.

29
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:07,920
Two

30
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,160
full

31
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,720
rotations.

32
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,320
Airborne

33
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,480
with

34
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,600
a

35
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,800
board

36
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,080
strapped

37
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,160
to

38
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,280
his

39
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,600
feet.

40
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:10,840
This

41
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,080
isn't

42
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,240
just

43
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,400
a

44
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,720
trick,

45
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,000
it's

46
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,080
a

47
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,480
monumental

48
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,720
moment

49
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:12,840
in

50
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,040
water

51
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,440
sports.

52
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,760
Proving

53
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:13,880
that

54
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,000
with

55
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,160
enough

56
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,440
guts

57
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:14,560
and

58
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:14,800
skill,

59
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,160
anything

60
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,320
is

61
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,600
possible.

62
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,999
An

63
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:16,520
absolutely

64
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,720
mind

65
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,040
blowing

66
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,520
achievement.
