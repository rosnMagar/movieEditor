Hey there, fruit fanatics. Did you know bananas are more than

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,400
just a tasty snack? Get ready to have your mind peeled with

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,600
these crazy banana facts. Bananas are technically berries.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,520
Who knew they float in water because they are less dense than water.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,280
Try it. Bananas are radioactive. But don't worry,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,360
you'd need to eat millions to be affected. The Cavendish banana,

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,010
the one you usually eat, is not the original banana. It replaced

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,770
the Gros Me shell after a disease wiped it out.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,770
Bananas can help improve your mood. They contain tryptophan,

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,610
which the body converts to serotonin. Banana plants

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,170
are actually giant herbs, not trees. You can use banana peels

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,370
to polish your shoes. Seriously. Bananas are grown in over 107

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,010
countries. The inside of a banana peel can help relieve

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,900
itching from mosquito bites. Bananas are a great source of

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,980
potassium, which is important for maintaining healthy blood pressure.

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,740
Some people are allergic to bananas. It's called latex

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,780
fruit syndrome. Mind blown, right? Which fact surprised

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,340
you the most? Tell me in the comments. And hey, try typing

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,820
